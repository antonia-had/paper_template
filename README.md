## Abstract

> Paper abstract

## Code implementation and references

> Briefly describe the software/scripts used to produce the results of the
> paper. The following is an example:

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `results`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.

## Using the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/antonia-had/paper_template.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/antonia-had/paper_template/archive/master.zip).

A copy of the repository is also archived at *insert DOI here*


## Dependencies

> Depending on your project, the script might depend on several other packages
> to run. If using Python, you can use a '.yml' file specifying your dependencies.
> You can create one and place it in the repository so subsequent users take it
> and create a Python environment with all they need to replicate your results.
> This section should then describe how one can set up an environment with the
> dependencies necessary to run your code.

You'll need Python *version number* to run the code.
You can set up an environment with all dependencies using an environment manager
like [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
provides the `conda` package manager.
Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
the system Python installation.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `environment.yml`.

Run the following command in the repository folder (where `environment.yml`
is located) to create a separate environment and install all required
dependencies in it:

    conda env create

## Data
> You need to either provide or cite the data used in your analysis.
> Avoid cluttering your repository with a lot of raw data but instead archive and
> mint a DOI for your data.

## Reproducing the results

> Here you should include all information necessary to reproduce your results.
> Ideally, you'd set up a makefile that automates as much as possible, but make
> sure to provide clear step-by-step instructions for everything.
> The following can be used as example of replicating Python code.

Activate the conda environment:

    source activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

or, on Windows:

    activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

To build and test the software, produce all results and figures, follow these steps:
